# stock_forecasting

This project aims to predict stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. It uses historical data for Amazon stock prices as input to the LSTM network to make predictions for future stock prices.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to have the following software installed:

  Python 3
  PyTorch
  Pandas
  NumPy
  Matplotlib
  Scikit-Learn
  
  Modifying the Code
If you wish to modify the code, you can open the untitled.ipynb file and make changes as necessary. You can modify the LSTM architecture by changing the LSTM class in the code. You can also adjust the hyperparameters such as the learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size.

Contributing
If you wish to contribute to this project, you can fork the repository and make changes to the code. You can then create a pull request to have your changes merged into the main branch.
